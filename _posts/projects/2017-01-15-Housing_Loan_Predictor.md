title: Housing Loan Approval System
category: projects
---

Using ShinyApps, I developed an interactive, end-to-end application that predicts whether a housing loan can be approved (or not) for customers when they apply for a loan at a financial institution. To predict the status, the customer's basic personal and financial information are collected and fed into the system.

Based on the existing dataset, the system trains 5 different models and predicts the loan status of a new customer for each model. The final loan status will be determined by the majority ranking of all the 5 models.
