title: Housing Loan Approval System
category: projects
---

Using ShinyApps, I developed an interactive, end-to-end application that predicts whether a Housing Loan can be approved (or not) for a customers when they apply for a loan in a financial institution. To predict the status, basic personal and financial information are collected and fed into the system. 

Based on the existing dataset, the system trains 5 different models and predicts the status for each model. The final loan status will be determined by the majority ranking of all the 5 models.
