title: Face and Eyes Detector using OpenCV
category: blog

Human vision is one of the most complex functions of the brain. Computer Vision(CV), a sub-discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) attempts to replicate some visual functions of the brain, one of them being able to recognize faces. The first step is to detect the face. In this demo video feed, I used the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org){:target="_blank"} library to detect the face and eyes of myself and pictures behind me.

Face detection in video has a wide range of applications.  For example, in video surveillance, you can use automatic face detection to detect if someone just came into the view of the camera and send out an alert, instead of having a person constantly looking at the video for human activity.
