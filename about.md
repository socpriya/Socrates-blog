  Hi, am Socrates Krishnamurthy and welcome to my Data Science Blog!
</p>

I am a Data Scientist working on multiple data science projects for Government and Corporates. During my free time, I upgrade myself by learning new Machine Learning algorithms and tools. 

A quote that insprired me recently is, _The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn._

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [contact me](mailto:socratesk@gmail.com?Subject=Hi%20there!).

Thanks for reading!
