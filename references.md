In [Chicago Food Inspection Forecasting]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects.html) project, the number of days before an inspection has to be made was forecasted as 6.55 days with _GLM_ and _Random Forest_ predictive models. I developed a model using _XGBoost algorithm_ and arrived at 7.79 days - an improvement of 1.24 days (19%).
