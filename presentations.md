As a previous member of American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS), I had an opportunity to attend a conference in Chicago, IL presented by <b>Sears Holdings Corporation</b> on their 'Real-time Inventory Tracking System using Big Data Tools'. Thanks Sears for sharing this public info to community! 

I have reproduced the personal notes taken during the conference [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/SearsCorp.pdf)
