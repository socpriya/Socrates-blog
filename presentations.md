In Chicago TensorFlow meetup, I gave a presentation and [code walk-through](https://github.com/socratesk/ImagePredictor){:target="_blank"} of how a pre-trained machine learning model can be built as an interactive web application for inference. Further, I showcased a [web application](https://imagepredictor.herokuapp.com/upload){:target="_blank"} developed using a pre-trained Deep Learning model (ResNet50).
